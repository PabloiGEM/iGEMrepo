            <h1>Project Description</h1>

            <p>Agricultal loss due to frost damage is a prevalent problem
                in our region, particularly on apricot trees, and has caused 
                enormous losses in the past few years. In 2021, the loss for 
                apricot farmers was astronomical, so we felt called to address 
                this situation. This year, we are creating a two-step protection 
                system to diminish thedamage caused by frost on the fruit trees in
                our region. The first step is preventative, and aims to inactivate 
                Pseudomonas Syringae, a fruit pathogen that produces Ice Nucleation 
                Proteins (INP). This pathogen causes frost damage at higher 
                temperatures and greatly worsens the problem. The second step is 
                designed to be used as a last resort, in the case of extremely low 
                spring temperatures. We are creating an Anti-Freeze Protein solution 
                slow freezing on the plants, mitigating the damage done to 
                the tissues.</p>
